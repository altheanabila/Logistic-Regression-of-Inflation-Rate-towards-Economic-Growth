# Logistic-Regression-of-Inflation-Rate-towards-Economic-Growth
I try to find the correlation between inflation rate and Economic Growth in Germany. Using logistic regression in python, I assigned the Economic growth in binary variable as positive = 1 and negative = 0.

1. Import python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib

2. Assign df and extracting the data [data.excel](https://github.com/altheanabila/Logistic-Regression-of-Inflation-Rate-towards-Economic-Growth/blob/main/logitreg2.xlsx)

3. Assign x variable and y variable

3. Using logistic regression syntax for python

4. import stats model using this line `import statsmodels.api as sn`

5. Assign constant for X variable

6. Run the logit syntax. As we can see that correlation is negatively correlated with p value stood below 5%

7. Visualize the data through scatter plot
